📊 Excel Data Analysis & Reporting Project

📌 Project Overview
     

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis using Microsoft Excel, covering data transformation, descriptive statistics, data analysis, and reporting.
The objective is to convert raw transactional data into clear, actionable business insights using Excel tools.

🛠 Tool Used

Microsoft Excel

🔄 Data Transformation

The raw dataset was cleaned and prepared for analysis using Excel:

1)Converted raw data into an Excel Table
2)Removed duplicate records
3)Trimmed extra spaces using TRIM()
4)Standardized formats for dates, text, and numerical values
5)Ensured data consistency for accurate analysis

📈 Descriptive Statistics

1)Performed descriptive statistical analysis to understand data distribution and variability:
2)Mean
3)Median
4)Minimum & Maximum
5)Standard Deviation
6)Count
7)Interquartile Range (IQR)
Outlier detection using Box & Whisker plots
This helped identify skewness, variability, and extreme values before deeper analysis.

🔍 Data Analysis (Pivot Tables)

Used Pivot Tables to analyze key business metrics:
Revenue breakdown by city
Revenue trends over time
Identification of top-performing and low-performing locations
Comparison of daily revenue patterns

📊 Reporting & Visualization

Created business-friendly visual reports using Excel charts:
Line chart for revenue trends over time
Column chart for city-wise revenue comparison
Box & Whisker chart to visualize distribution and outliers
Clean layout for easy interpretation by stakeholders

💡 Key Insights
Lisbon generated the highest total revenue among all cities
Daily revenue remained relatively stable with occasional dips
Berlin and Paris showed lower revenue contribution compared to other cities
Median provided a better central measure due to presence of outliers

🚀 Project Outcome

This project showcases the ability to:
Clean and transform raw data
Apply statistical concepts practically in Excel
Perform structured analysis using Pivot Tables
Communicate insights effectively through charts and reports

🧠 Learnings
Data cleaning is critical before analysis
Median & IQR are more reliable than mean when outliers exist
Pivot Tables simplify complex analysis
Visual storytelling improves business decision-making
